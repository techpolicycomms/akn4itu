DUBAI, 2018) Measures for improving ITU's efficiency and reducing its expenses 1) Identification and elimination of all forms and instances of duplication of functions and activities between all ITU structural bodies and measures. Coordination, harmonization and closer cooperation among the Sectors, including optimization of management methods, logistics, coordination and support by the secretariat as well as centralization of finance and administrative tasks. 2) Coordination and harmonization of all seminars, workshops and cross- sector activities by the secretariat's Inter-Sectoral Coordination Task Force (ISC-TF) in order to avoid duplication of topics, to optimize management, logistics, coordination and secretariat support and to benefit from synergy between the Sectors and a holistic approach to the subjects covered. 3) Enhanced efficiency in respect of regional offices in implementing the goals and objectives of ITU as a whole, as well as in the use of local experts and local networks of contacts and resources. Maximum coordination of activities with regional organizations and rational use of existing financial and human resources, including savings on travel costs and costs associated with the planning and organization of events held outside Geneva. 4) Savings from attrition, redeployment of staff and review and possible reduction of grades of vacant posts, in particular in non-sensitive parts of the General Secretariat and the three Bureaux, in order to reach optimal levels of productivity, efficiency and effectiveness. 5) Prioritizing staff redeployment for the implementation of new or additional activities. New hiring should be the last option, while taking into account gender balance, geographical distribution and new skill requirements. 6) The use of consultants should only occur when the relevant skills or experience cannot be found among existing staff and after confirmation of this requirement in writing by senior management. 7) Upgrading the capacity-building policy to qualify the staff, including staff in regional offices, for multi-sector proficiency, in order to improve staff mobility and their flexibility for redeployment to new or additional activities. 8) Reduction by the General Secretariat and the three Sectors of the Union of the cost of documentation by, among other measures, conducting paperless conferences and meetings of all kinds and at all levels; encouraging staff to avoid printing of e-mails and documents; reducing the archiving of additional paper documentation; pursuing initiatives aimed at making ITU a fully paperless organization; and fostering the adoption of innovative information and communication technology (ICT) solutions as viable and sustainable substitutes for paper, without any significant decrease in the quality of the information provided to event participants or to ITU staff in the course of their day-to-day work. 9) Reducing to the absolute minimum necessary the printing and distribution of ITU promotional/non-revenue generating publications. 10) Implementation of practicable measures for making savings in the provision of interpretation and the translation of ITU documents, including minimizing the length of documents, and in the preparation of publications for events of all kinds and at all levels, without prejudice to the goals of Resolution 154 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, as well as through optimization of resource usage in the language services, including the use of alternative translation procedures, while maintaining translation quality and the accuracy of telecommunication/ICT terminology. 11) Increasing the efficiency of World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) programme activities and activities aimed at achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, consistent with the financial plan and the biennial budget and, as appropriate, through cost recovery and voluntary contributions. Participation by the regional offices, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies, in WSIS activities being carried out at the regional level. 12) Optimization of the number and duration of meetings, and holding such meetings with the aid of ICT capabilities. Reduction of the number of groups to the minimum necessary through their restructuring and/or termination of their work in the absence of any outcomes and/or where there is duplication of activities, while avoiding any risk, in particular, of failure to fulfil the strategic and operational goals and objectives of the Union. 13) Regular assessment of the level of achievement of the strategic goals, objectives and outputs with a view to increasing efficiency through budget reallocation, when necessary. 14) For new activities or those having additional financial resource implications, a "value-added" assessment shall be made and implemented in order to improve efficiency and to avoid overlap and duplication. 15) Sound consideration of the size of, location of and resources allocated to regional initiatives, outputs and assistance to members, the regional presence both in the regions and at headquarters, as well as those actions resulting from the outcome of the World Telecommunication Development Conference and the Buenos Aires Action Plan, and financed directly as activities from the Sector budget. 16) Reduction of the cost of travel on duty, by developing and implementing criteria in order to reduce travel costs. The criteria should consider and aim at minimizing business travel, as far as possible, by prioritizing the allocation of staff from the regional and area offices, by limiting time on mission, through joint representation in meetings, and by rationalizing the number of staff sent on mission from various departments/divisions of the General Secretariat and the three Bureaux. 17) Appeals to Member States to reduce to the minimum necessary the number of issues raised and the time devoted to their consideration at all conferences, assemblies and other meetings. 18) Continued implementation by the Union of the comprehensive plan to improve the stability and predictability of the financial base of the Union, mobilizing the necessary resources and, inter alia, improving the management of internal corporate projects requiring significant long-term investments. 19) Member States, Sector Members and other ITU members taking all possible measures to settle/eliminate arrears to the Union. 20) Optimization of expenses related to maintenance, routine repair and renovation/reconstruction of the ITU buildings and facilities and to the provision of safety in accordance with applicable United Nations system standards. 21) Increased use of virtual meetings and remote participation in physical meetings in order to reduce and/or eliminate travel to meetings the proceedings of which are webcast and, preferably, captioned, including remote presentation of documents and contributions. 22) Introduction of innovative cross-cutting means and working methods for improving the Union's productivity. 23) Discontinuing to the greatest extent possible communications by fax and traditional postal mail between the Union and Member States, and replacing them with modern electronic communication methods. 24) Continuing the efforts to simplify, harmonize or eliminate, as appropriate, internal administrative processes, for subsequent digitization and automation. 25) Consideration of further sharing of some common services with other United Nations organizations, and implementation of such sharing where beneficial. 26) Appeals to Member States, to the extent possible, with the support of the secretariat, to include in their proposals to ITU conferences an annex with relevant information in order to allow the Secretary-General/Directors of the Bureaux to identify the probable financial implications of such proposals. 27) Any additional measures adopted by the Council and the ITU management, including measures to increase the efficiency of the internal audit function, institutionalize evaluation functions, assess and minimize the risk of fraud and other risks, implement external auditor, Independent Management Advisory Committee and Joint Inspection Unit recommendations in a timely manner, and implement the information technology and information management strategy.</p>
