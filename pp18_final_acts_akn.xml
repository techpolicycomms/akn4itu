DUBAI, 2018) Measures for improving ITU's efficiency and reducing its expenses 1) Identification and elimination of all forms and instances of duplication of functions and activities between all ITU structural bodies and measures. Coordination, harmonization and closer cooperation among the Sectors, including optimization of management methods, logistics, coordination and support by the secretariat as well as centralization of finance and administrative tasks. 2) Coordination and harmonization of all seminars, workshops and cross- sector activities by the secretariat's Inter-Sectoral Coordination Task Force (ISC-TF) in order to avoid duplication of topics, to optimize management, logistics, coordination and secretariat support and to benefit from synergy between the Sectors and a holistic approach to the subjects covered. 3) Enhanced efficiency in respect of regional offices in implementing the goals and objectives of ITU as a whole, as well as in the use of local experts and local networks of contacts and resources. Maximum coordination of activities with regional organizations and rational use of existing financial and human resources, including savings on travel costs and costs associated with the planning and organization of events held outside Geneva. 4) Savings from attrition, redeployment of staff and review and possible reduction of grades of vacant posts, in particular in non-sensitive parts of the General Secretariat and the three Bureaux, in order to reach optimal levels of productivity, efficiency and effectiveness. 5) Prioritizing staff redeployment for the implementation of new or additional activities. New hiring should be the last option, while taking into account gender balance, geographical distribution and new skill requirements. 6) The use of consultants should only occur when the relevant skills or experience cannot be found among existing staff and after confirmation of this requirement in writing by senior management. 7) Upgrading the capacity-building policy to qualify the staff, including staff in regional offices, for multi-sector proficiency, in order to improve staff mobility and their flexibility for redeployment to new or additional activities. 8) Reduction by the General Secretariat and the three Sectors of the Union of the cost of documentation by, among other measures, conducting paperless conferences and meetings of all kinds and at all levels; encouraging staff to avoid printing of e-mails and documents; reducing the archiving of additional paper documentation; pursuing initiatives aimed at making ITU a fully paperless organization; and fostering the adoption of innovative information and communication technology (ICT) solutions as viable and sustainable substitutes for paper, without any significant decrease in the quality of the information provided to event participants or to ITU staff in the course of their day-to-day work. 9) Reducing to the absolute minimum necessary the printing and distribution of ITU promotional/non-revenue generating publications. 10) Implementation of practicable measures for making savings in the provision of interpretation and the translation of ITU documents, including minimizing the length of documents, and in the preparation of publications for events of all kinds and at all levels, without prejudice to the goals of Resolution 154 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, as well as through optimization of resource usage in the language services, including the use of alternative translation procedures, while maintaining translation quality and the accuracy of telecommunication/ICT terminology. 11) Increasing the efficiency of World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) programme activities and activities aimed at achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, consistent with the financial plan and the biennial budget and, as appropriate, through cost recovery and voluntary contributions. Participation by the regional offices, in collaboration with other United Nations agencies, in WSIS activities being carried out at the regional level. 12) Optimization of the number and duration of meetings, and holding such meetings with the aid of ICT capabilities. Reduction of the number of groups to the minimum necessary through their restructuring and/or termination of their work in the absence of any outcomes and/or where there is duplication of activities, while avoiding any risk, in particular, of failure to fulfil the strategic and operational goals and objectives of the Union. 13) Regular assessment of the level of achievement of the strategic goals, objectives and outputs with a view to increasing efficiency through budget reallocation, when necessary. 14) For new activities or those having additional financial resource implications, a "value-added" assessment shall be made and implemented in order to improve efficiency and to avoid overlap and duplication. 15) Sound consideration of the size of, location of and resources allocated to regional initiatives, outputs and assistance to members, the regional presence both in the regions and at headquarters, as well as those actions resulting from the outcome of the World Telecommunication Development Conference and the Buenos Aires Action Plan, and financed directly as activities from the Sector budget. 16) Reduction of the cost of travel on duty, by developing and implementing criteria in order to reduce travel costs. The criteria should consider and aim at minimizing business travel, as far as possible, by prioritizing the allocation of staff from the regional and area offices, by limiting time on mission, through joint representation in meetings, and by rationalizing the number of staff sent on mission from various departments/divisions of the General Secretariat and the three Bureaux. 17) Appeals to Member States to reduce to the minimum necessary the number of issues raised and the time devoted to their consideration at all conferences, assemblies and other meetings. 18) Continued implementation by the Union of the comprehensive plan to improve the stability and predictability of the financial base of the Union, mobilizing the necessary resources and, inter alia, improving the management of internal corporate projects requiring significant long-term investments. 19) Member States, Sector Members and other ITU members taking all possible measures to settle/eliminate arrears to the Union. 20) Optimization of expenses related to maintenance, routine repair and renovation/reconstruction of the ITU buildings and facilities and to the provision of safety in accordance with applicable United Nations system standards. 21) Increased use of virtual meetings and remote participation in physical meetings in order to reduce and/or eliminate travel to meetings the proceedings of which are webcast and, preferably, captioned, including remote presentation of documents and contributions. 22) Introduction of innovative cross-cutting means and working methods for improving the Union's productivity. 23) Discontinuing to the greatest extent possible communications by fax and traditional postal mail between the Union and Member States, and replacing them with modern electronic communication methods. 24) Continuing the efforts to simplify, harmonize or eliminate, as appropriate, internal administrative processes, for subsequent digitization and automation. 25) Consideration of further sharing of some common services with other United Nations organizations, and implementation of such sharing where beneficial. 26) Appeals to Member States, to the extent possible, with the support of the secretariat, to include in their proposals to ITU conferences an annex with relevant information in order to allow the Secretary-General/Directors of the Bureaux to identify the probable financial implications of such proposals. 27) Any additional measures adopted by the Council and the ITU management, including measures to increase the efficiency of the internal audit function, institutionalize evaluation functions, assess and minimize the risk of fraud and other risks, implement external auditor, Independent Management Advisory Committee and Joint Inspection Unit recommendations in a timely manner, and implement the information technology and information management strategy.</p>

                  <p>with the approval of the Council, upon request from the countries concerned, to update the annex to this resolution as needed. ANNEX TO RESOLUTION 34 (REV. DUBAI, 2018) Afghanistan As a result of the past 24 years of war in Afghanistan, the telecommunication system has been destroyed and needs urgent attention for its basic reconstruction. Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, appropriate assistance and support shall be provided to the Government of Afghanistan in rebuilding its telecommunication system. Burundi, Timor-Leste, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, appropriate assistance and support shall be provided to these countries in rebuilding their telecommunication networks. Democratic Republic of the Congo The basic telecommunication infrastructure of the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been severely damaged by the conflicts and wars from which the country has suffered for more than a decade. As part of the reform of the telecommunication sector undertaken by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, involving the separation of the operating and regulatory functions, two regulatory bodies have been instituted along with a basic telecommunication network, which requires adequate financial resources in order to be built. Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of this conference, appropriate assistance and support shall be provided to the Democratic Republic of the Congo for rebuilding its basic telecommunication network. Lebanon Lebanon's telecommunication facilities have been severely damaged due to wars in that country. Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, Lebanon shall be provided with appropriate assistance and support in rebuilding its telecommunication network. As Lebanon has not received any financial assistance, it shall continue to be supported within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018), with a view to pursuing work for Lebanon to obtain the necessary financial assistance. Central African Republic The Central African Republic's telecommunication facilities have been severely damaged due to military-political wars in that country. It is acknowledged, however, that a reliable telecommunication network is essential in promoting the socio-economic development of countries, especially those that have suffered natural disasters, domestic conflict or war, in order to enable them to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, the Central African Republic shall be provided with appropriate assistance and support in rebuilding its telecommunication network and in constructing its national and international optical fibre network. As the Central African Republic has not received any financial assistance, it shall continue to be supported within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) with a view to pursuing work for the Central African Republic to obtain the necessary financial assistance. Somalia The telecommunication infrastructure in the Federal Republic of Somalia has been completely destroyed by two and a half decades of war and, in addition, the regulatory framework and the rule of law in the communication sector in the country need to be re-established. Somalia has not benefited adequately from the Union's assistance over a long period due to war in the country and lack of a functioning government for two and a half decades. Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, and using funds allocated to the programme of assistance for the least developed countries, a special initiative shall be launched, aimed at providing assistance and support to Somalia in rebuilding and modernizing its telecommunication infrastructure, re-establishing a well-equipped ministry of telecommunications and establishing institutions, and developing telecommunication/information and communication technology policy, legislation and regulation, including a numbering plan, spectrum management, tariff and human resource capacity building, and all other necessary forms of assistance. South Sudan The Republic of South Sudan has gone through more than two decades of civil war which shattered lives, destroyed property, broke down institutions and wrecked the existing rudimentary infrastructure. With the onset of peace, South Sudan emerged as a sovereign country, but completely lacking in telecommunication infrastructure, which is now badly needed for the development of its people. Within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, appropriate assistance and support shall be provided to the Government of the Republic of South Sudan in building its telecommunication system, policy and regulatory framework as well as its capacities. Yemen The telecommunication infrastructure in the Republic of Yemen requires appropriate assistance and support, within the framework of Resolution 34 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference, for the rebuilding of its basic telecommunication networks, overhauling of telecommunication and information technology infrastructure, development of human resources through the setting up of training operations inside and outside Yemeni territory as necessary, secondment of experts to address the shortfall in expertise in some areas and the provision of other forms of support and assistance.</p>

                      <p>Strategic risk management Bearing in mind the prevailing challenges, evolutions and transformations that have the most potential to impact on ITU activities during the period of the strategic plan, the list of top-level strategic risks presented in Table 2 below has been identified, analysed and evaluated. These risks have been considered when planning the strategy for 2020-2023, and the corresponding mitigation measures have been identified as necessary. It should be emphasized that the strategic risks are not meant to represent deficiencies of ITU's operations. They represent forward-looking uncertainties that may affect efforts to fulfil the mission of the Union during the period of the strategic plan. ITU has identified, analysed and assessed these strategic risks. Apart from the strategic planning processes, setting the overall framework on how to mitigate these risks, operational mitigation measures will be defined and implemented through the operational planning process of the Union. Table 2: Strategic risks and mitigation strategies Risk Mitigation strategy 1 Diminishing relevance and ability to demonstrate clear added value − Risk of duplication of efforts and inconsistencies inside the organization that affects our ability to demonstrate added value − Risk of conflicting efforts, inconsistencies and competition with other relevant organizations and bodies that leads to misperception of ITU's mandate, mission and role − Risk avoidance: By clear mandates of each structure and role in the Union − Risk limitation: Improve the cooperation framework − Risk avoidance: Identify and concentrate on areas with clear added value − Risk transfer: By establishing long-term partnerships − Risk limitation: By an appropriate and consistent communication strategy (internal and external) Risk Mitigation strategy 2 Spreading too thin − Risk of mission dilution and losing sight of the organization's core mandate − Risk avoidance: By prioritizing, focusing and building on the strengths of the Union − Risk limitation: By ensuring consistency of ITU activities / working outside silos 3 Failure to respond quickly to emerging needs and innovate sufficiently while still providing high-quality deliverables − Risk of unresponsiveness, leading to disengagement of the membership and other stakeholders − Risk of being left behind − Risk of lower quality deliverables − Risk avoidance: Plan for the future while being agile, responsive and innovative, focus on purposes of the Union − Risk limitation: Define, promote and implement a fit-for-purpose organizational culture − Risk transfer: proactively engage stakeholders 4 Concerns regarding trust and confidence − Risk of rising concerns related to trust on the part of the membership and stakeholders − Risk of rising concerns on confidence within membership − Risk avoidance: Adopt and implement common values - all actions guided by the adopted values − Risk limitation: Engage with the membership and other stakeholders, improve communication and transparency, commit to the values, and promote ownership of strategic initiatives; ensure adherence to the core mission and goals and organizational procedures Risk Mitigation strategy 5 Inadequate internal structures, tools, methodology and processes − Risk of structures, methods and tools becoming inadequate, failing to be effective − Risk limitation: Optimize internal structures, improve tools, methodologies and processes − Risk transfer: Initiate processes for quality control − Risk limitation: Improve internal and external communication 6 Insufficient funding − Risk of reduced financial contributions and sources of revenue − Risk limitation: Identify and explore new markets and players; prioritization of core activities − Risk limitation: Ensure effective financial planning − Risk limitation: Membership engagement strategies − Risk transfer: Increase the relevance of ITU activities</p>

                  <p>Linkage with the WSIS action lines and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Linkage with the WSIS action lines ITU has a leading role in the WSIS process where, as a lead facilitator, along with UNESCO and UNDP, it coordinates the multistakeholder implementation of the Geneva Plan of Action. Notably, ITU is the sole facilitator for three different WSIS action lines: C2 (Information and communication infrastructure); C5 (Building confidence and security in the use of ICTs); and C6 (Enabling environment). Mapping ITU outputs and key activities to WSIS action lines (based on information from the ITU SDG mapping tool) Linkage with the Sustainable Development Goals With the adoption of the United Nations General Assembly resolution on transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, ITU, along with the rest of the UN family, needs to support Member States and contribute to the worldwide efforts to achieve the SDGs. The associated 17 SDGs and 169 related targets offer a holistic vision for the UN system. The role of ICTs as essential catalysts to fast-forward achievement of the SDGs is clearly highlighted in the 2030 Agenda: "the spread of information and communications technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide, and to develop knowledge societies". The Union, as the UN specialized agency for ICTs and global connectivity, has a key role to play in promoting prosperity in our digital world. In order to maximize its contribution to the 2030 Agenda, ITU's primary focus is in addressing SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) and target 9.c aiming to significantly increase access to ICTs and provide universal and affordable access to the Internet. Indeed, the infrastructure that powers our world and forms the backbone of the new digital economy is vital. It is essential to so many of the technological applications and potential solutions to the SDGs, and is crucial for making them both global and scalable. Since SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals) highlights ICTs as a means of implementation, with cross-cutting transformative potential, it is imperative that ITU leverage this broad impact. Notable SDGs where ITU has a particularly strong impact include SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 10 (Reduced inequalities), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 1 (No poverty), SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 4 (Quality education) and SDG 5 (Gender equality). It is, therefore, through infrastructure and connectivity and in partnership with all stakeholders that ITU will contribute the most towards achieving the remaining SDGs. Mapping ITU outputs and key activities to SDGs (as per the ITU SDG mapping tool3) ____________________ 3 ITU SDG mapping tool: https://www.itu.int/sdgmappingtool. ITU is also the custodian of five SDG indicators (4.4.1, 5.b.1, 9.c.1, 17.6.2 and 17.8.1) contributing to UNSTAT's monitoring of the SDGs. The following table provides a linkage between the five ITU strategic goals for 2020-2023 and the SDGs. SDG indicators with a reference to ICTs are highlighted in bold.

                  <p>Implementation and evaluation of the strategic plan The strong and coherent linkage between the Union's strategic, operational and financial planning is ensured by implementing the ITU results-based management (RBM) framework in accordance with Resolutions 71 and 151 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) of the Plenipotentiary Conference. Results will be the main focus of strategy, planning and budgeting in the ITU RBM framework. Performance monitoring and evaluation, together with risk management, will ensure that the strategic, operational and financial planning processes are based on informed decision-making and appropriate resource allocation. The ITU performance monitoring and evaluation framework will be further developed according to the strategic framework outlined in the strategic plan for 2020-2023, to measure progress towards achievement of the ITU objectives and outcomes, strategic goals and targets set out therein, evaluating performance and detecting issues that need to be addressed.</p>

                  <p>SDG links to ITU strategic plan by strategic goal Growth Inclusiveness Sustainability Innovation Partnership The ITU risk-management framework will be further developed, to ensure an integrated approach to the ITU RBM framework set out in the strategic plan for the Union for 2020-2023. Implementation criteria Implementation criteria set the framework to enable proper identification of appropriate activities of the Union, so that the objectives, outcomes and strategic goals of the Union are achieved in the most effective and efficient manner. They define the criteria for establishing priorities for the resource- allocation process within the biennial budget of the Union. The implementation criteria set for the Union's strategy for 2020-2023 are: - Adherence to ITU values: The core values of ITU shall drive priorities and provide the basis for decision-making. - Following results-based management principles, including: • Performance monitoring and evaluation: Performance in the achievement of the goals/objectives shall be monitored and evaluated in accordance with the operational plans, as approved by the Council, and opportunities for improvement shall be identified, in order to support the decision-making process. • Risk identification, assessment and treatment: An integrated process to manage uncertain events that may have an impact on the achievement of objectives and goals shall be in place, to enhance informed decision-making. • Results-based budgeting principles: The budgeting process shall allocate resources on the basis of the goals and objectives to be achieved, as defined within this strategic plan. • Impact-oriented reporting: Progress towards the achievement of ITU's strategic goals shall be clearly reported, focusing on the impact of the activities of the Union. - Implementing efficiently: Efficiency has become an overarching imperative for the Union. ITU shall assess whether its stakeholders obtain maximum benefit from the services ITU provides, according to the resources available (value for money). - Aiming to mainstream United Nations recommendations and apply harmonized business practices, since ITU is part of the UN system as a UN specialized agency. - Working as One ITU: The Sectors shall work cohesively for the implementation of the strategic plan. The secretariat shall support coordinated operational planning, avoiding redundancies and duplication and maximizing synergies across the Sectors, the Bureaux and the General Secretariat. - Long-term development of the organization to sustain performance and relevance of expertise: Aspiring to the concept of the learning organization, the organization shall continue operating in an interconnected way and to invest further in staff so as to sustainably deliver most value. - Prioritization: It is important to define specific criteria for prioritizing among different activities and initiatives that the Union is willing to undertake. The factors to be considered are the following: • Added value: - Prioritize based on unique value contribution by ITU (outcomes that cannot be achieved otherwise) - Be involved where and to the extent that ITU adds significant value - Not prioritize activities that other stakeholders can undertake - Prioritize based on ITU's available expertise for implementation. • Impact and focus: - Focus on maximum impact for the wider constituency, while considering inclusiveness - Undertake fewer activities with greater impact, rather than many activities with diluted impact - Be consistent and undertake activities that clearly contribute to the big picture as determined by the ITU strategic framework - Give priority to activities yielding tangible results. • Membership needs: - Prioritize membership demands, by following a customer- oriented approach - Give priority to activities that Member States cannot implement without the support of the organization.

                  <p>Situational analysis 2.a Strategic situational analysis ITU as a part of the United Nations system ITU is the United Nations specialized agency for telecommunications/ICTs. It allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits, develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect, and strives to improve access to telecommunications/ICTs for underserved communities worldwide. The Union is committed to connecting all the world's people - wherever they live and whatever their means. ITU's work aims to protect and support everyone's fundamental right to communicate. Lessons learnt from the ITU strategic plan for 2016-2019 The strategic plan for the Union for 2016-2019, adopted by the ITU Member States at the Plenipotentiary Conference in 2014, became the basis for the adoption of the Connect 2020 Agenda for Global Telecommunication/ICT Development, setting out the shared vision, goals and targets that Member States committed to achieve by 2020, in collaboration with all stakeholders across the ICT ecosystem. The 2016-2019 strategic plan outlined the work of the Union towards implementing its four strategic goals: Growth, Inclusiveness, Sustainability and Innovation and partnership. In the strategic plan for 2016-2019, each strategic goal aimed to reinforce the other: in growing ICT access, the ITU membership aimed to foster growth in the use of ICTs and create a positive impact on short- and long-term socio-economic development. By including everyone, the benefits of ICTs were to be extended to all - towards bridging the digital divide between the developed and developing worlds, but also reaching marginalized and vulnerable populations within all countries. The ability to sustain the tremendous benefits from ICTs required recognition that growth also brings challenges and risks that need to be managed. By innovating and advancing partnerships, the evolving ICT ecosystem could ensure its adaptation to the rapidly changing technological, economic and social environment. The overall results of the implementation of the strategic plan and the Connect 2020 Agenda have been impressive, even though much more needs to be done. Member States are expected to achieve many of the Connect 2020 targets set on connectivity before the year 2020. For example, target 1.2 aiming to ensure that 60% of individuals worldwide are using the Internet, i.e. bringing an additional 1.5 billion people online from 2014 to 2020, is on track to be achieved, particularly due to the strong growth in developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs). Targets 2.2.A and 2.2.B aiming to ensure that 50% of individuals are connected in developing countries, and 20% in LDCs, are therefore also set to be achieved before 2020. Household connectivity targets are also expected to be achieved by 2020: target 1.1 aiming to achieve a rate of 55% of households connected worldwide, as well as, under Goal 2, a target of 50% and 15% of households connected in developing countries (2.1.A) and in LDCs (2.1.B). However, 3.9 billion people are still estimated to be offline; the digital gender gap also persists; and although the costs of Internet access are falling, the goals set by the Connect 2020 Agenda to reduce the affordability gap between developed and developing countries may not be attained. The ITU strategic plan for 2016-2019 also introduced significant improvements internally for the organization, by strengthening the concept of working as "One ITU". The common vision, mission and strategic goals for the whole organization aimed for all the Sectors to work cohesively on the implementation of the strategic plan, and for the secretariat to support - in a coordinated fashion - the implementation of the operational plans, seeking to avoid redundancies and duplication, and maximizing synergies across the Sectors, the Bureaux and the General Secretariat. The plan introduced a strengthened results-based management approach for the organization, and a clearer linkage between the strategic, operational and financial plans, with a transparent allocation of resources to strategic goals and objectives (of the Sectors and the inter-Sectoral objectives). The new form of reporting on the implementation of the strategic plan, presenting the agreed key performance indicators for the outcomes of the work of the Sectors, and the support services provided by the secretariat - around 150 indicators in total, enabled the membership to better evaluate the results and the progress achieved.4 ____________________ 4 Reports available also online at: https://www.itu.int/annual-report-2016. Developments since the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference (Busan, 2014) This section introduces some of the key developments since the adoption of the previous strategic plan at the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference held in Busan, Republic of Korea, in October 2014, to be considered for the elaboration of the new strategic plan for 2020-2023. In September 2015, all Member States of the United Nations agreed on United Nations General Assembly Resolution 70/1, on transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, for all countries and all stakeholders to act in collaborative partnership and implement this plan for sustainable development. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and 169 targets agreed upon demonstrate the scale and ambition of this new universal agenda. Member States recognize in the 2030 Agenda that "the spread of information and communications technology and global interconnectedness has great potential to accelerate human progress, to bridge the digital divide, and to develop knowledge societies". ICTs have enormous potential to fast-forward progress on all the SDGs and improve people's lives in fundamental ways. Notable references include, SDG 9 (Industry, innovation and infrastructure) and in particular target 9.c to "significantly increase access to ICT and strive to provide universal and affordable access to Internet in the least developed countries by 2020", which introduces a clear notion that without the digital infrastructure the world would not be able to deliver scalable solutions to the SDGs. ICTs are specifically mentioned as a means of implementation under SDG 17 (Partnership for the Goals, target 17.8), highlighting their cross-cutting transformative potential. ICTs are also highlighted as the enabling technology to promote the empowerment of women under SDG 5 (Gender equality, target 5.b), while the importance of ICT skills is also recognized under SDG 4 (Quality education, target 4.b). ITU, as part of the United Nations system, needs to support Member States and to contribute towards the worldwide efforts to achieve the SDGs. All Member States agreed (and expressed in UNGA Resolution 70/1) that global engagement is required in support of implementation of all the Goals and targets, "bringing together Governments, the private sector, civil society, the United Nations system and other actors and mobilizing all available resources". In addition, all Member States called for close alignment between the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, by adopting UNGA Resolution 70/125, on the overall review of the implementation of the WSIS outcomes. In that resolution, a request is made to the United Nations entities facilitating the WSIS action lines to review their reporting and work plans to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda. In parallel, advances in the field of science, technology and engineering, including new and emerging trends, are driving substantial transformation not only for the telecommunication/ICT ecosystem, but for different industries, and need also to be taken into account for the development of the strategic plan of the Union for 2020-2023. Such advances and trends relate to digital transformation and include, inter alia, Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, IMT-2020, artificial intelligence (AI), big data, cloud computing, the so called "4th industrial revolution", smart cities, distributed ledger technologies, software-defined networking and network-function-virtualization, intelligent transport systems (ITS), and open source. The role of the digital economy and digital transformation is being widely recognized as a significant enabler and booster of sustainable development, as also highlighted by the G20 Digital Economy Ministerial Declaration: "Shaping Digitalization for an Interconnected World", agreed in Düsseldorf, Germany in April 2017. The common vision to seize the opportunities and tackle the evolving challenges of the digital economy was also reaffirmed in the G7 ICT and Industry Ministers' Declaration5 in Torino, Italy in September 2017, while the need for advancement and development of the digital economy was also highlighted in the Buenos Aires Declaration6 adopted at the World Telecommunication Development Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina in October 2017. Digitalization alters society and the economy: it means the comprehensive penetration, networking and change of almost all areas of life and work by ICTs. It stands for the ability to collect and analyse information. As never before, processing steps are now increasingly taking place in parallel - in real time. This permits enormous leaps in productivity, but also increases the speed of change. Products and services increasingly contain digital added value and are getting "smart" through incorporation into intelligent and networked systems. Technologies, smart applications and other innovations in the digital economy can improve services and help address policy challenges in a wide range of areas7, including, inter alia, healthcare, agriculture, public governance, tax, transport, education and the environment. ICTs contribute not just to ____________________ 5 G7 ICT and Industry Ministers' Declaration: Making the next production revolution inclusive, open And secure. 6 ITU WTDC-17 - Buenos Aires Declaration. 7 Source: Key issues for digital transformation in the G20, G20 German Presidency/OECD. innovation in products, but also to innovation in processes and organizational arrangements. While being a catalyst for growth, digital technologies may also be disruptive, with effects on employment and well-being. While new technologies create opportunities for businesses (especially SMEs), and for workers and citizens to engage in economic activity, these technologies are also likely to displace workers doing specific tasks and may further increase existing gaps in access and use, resulting in new digital divides and greater inequality. Opportunities and threats for the Union The impact of the digital transformation and the growth of the digital economy creates new markets and new key players that have emerged in the telecommunication/ICT ecosystem. This creates new opportunities for ITU to engage with new members and partners, and discuss emerging challenges to digitalization, which may need to be managed through appropriate international cooperation, for example by sharing of best practices. Member States from the developing world are increasingly engaging in the multilateral system, which encourages all types of partnerships to be built, in order to overcome the obstacles to digitalization, and enable the exchange of resources, technology and knowledge in the global digital economy. ICTs are transforming society as well. In an era where everyone can create, access, utilize and share information and knowledge, this enables individuals, societies and people to achieve their full potential in promoting their sustainable development and improving their quality of life. The impact of ICTs can be catalytic on the implementation of the SDGs, from their impact on medical and social care to education, from enabling economic growth to reducing inequalities and empowering women and girls. ITU could be promoting this catalytic role. On the other hand, digital divides still exist, underscoring the importance of the Union achieving its connectivity objectives. More than half of the world's population is still offline (an estimated 3.9 billion people based on 2017 data), while in Africa almost three out of four people are non-Internet users. The digital gender gap also persists, whereby the proportion of men using the Internet is higher than the proportion of women using the Internet in two-thirds of all countries. In the least developed countries, only one in seven women is using the Internet, compared with one in five men. Mobile broadband costs more than 5 per cent of GNI per capita in most LDCs and is therefore unaffordable for the vast majority of the population. With regard to the industry, new business models have emerged for digital service providers, and increased competition is being observed. This brings into question the types of regulations required, contrasting the regulatory environment for online services with the environment for traditional telecommunication services. Finally, the rapid growth of ICTs and the increasingly digital world create particular challenges and increasing concerns that the Union may address, within the mandate given by the membership, such as the environmental impact; impacts on consumers; digital divides; issues affecting confidence and security in the use of ICTs in accordance with WSIS Action Line C5. The elements of a SWOT analysis to be considered in developing the strategy, presenting ITU's strengths and weaknesses as well as the opportunities and threats facing the organization, are introduced in the table below.

                  <p>Pressure from different stakeholders to implement unproven approaches 2.b General review of the targets of the strategic plan for 2016-2019 The strategic plan for 2016-2019 sets out four Goals: Growth, Inclusiveness, Sustainability, and Innovation and partnership, and, underlying each goal, several strategic targets (comprising the Connect 2020 Agenda targets). Target 1.1 aims to achieve a rate of 55% of households connected worldwide, and under Goal 2 there are corresponding targets of rates of 50% and 15% connected households in developing countries (2.1.A) and LDCs (2.1.B), respectively. All of these targets for households are expected to be achieved by the year 2020. Targets 1.2, 2.2.A and 2.2.B set aims in terms of the number of connected individuals worldwide (60%), in developing countries (50%) and in LDCs (20%), respectively. All of these targets are also currently set to be achieved in time for the 2020 deadline. Target 1.3 aims to make telecommunications/ICT 40% more affordable by 2020 in relation to the 2014 baseline. At the current rate, it is expected that the reduction in costs by 2020 will be about 32% on average, with a similar value for the drop in the affordability gap between developed and developing countries (target 2.3.A). Target 2.3.B aims to get the cost of Internet access to below 5% of GNI per capita, which is currently the case in 120 out of 160 countries for which data is available. It is expected that this number will increase by 2020, but that the target will not be achieved for all countries. Target 2.4 aims to ensure that 90% of the world's rural population will be covered by broadband services by 2020. Whether this target will be met or not depends to a large extent on how quickly 2G coverage will be replaced by 3G coverage. Currently, 2G covers well over 90% of the rural population, so with sufficient upgrades this target could be met. Gender equality in terms of Internet access is included as target 2.5.A. In recent years, the rapid growth in developing countries was paired with increasing gender inequality; however, the latest ITU data show that the gender gap is now decreasing, narrowing from 12.2% in 2016 to 11.6% in 2017. Having a strategy on ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities is included as target 2.5.B. Currently, 48 out of 64 reporting countries have a strategy that covers this aspect. Under target 3.1, cybersecurity readiness should be improved by 2020. Since 2016, ITU has been measuring this using the Global Cybersecurity Index, which will be used to assess this improvement in 2020. Target 4.1 aims to ensure a telecommunication/ICT environment that is conducive to innovation. Recent years have witnessed a rapid increase in the number of countries with a national innovation strategy to ensure this. ANNEX 3 TO RESOLUTION 71 (REV. DUBAI, 2018) Glossary of terms Term Working version Activities Activities are various actions/services for transforming resources (inputs) into outputs8. Financial plan The financial plan covers a four-year period and sets the financial basis from which biennial budgets are elaborated. The financial plan is elaborated within the context of Decision 5 (Revenue and expenses for the Union) which reflects, inter alia, the amount of the contributory unit approved by the Plenipotentiary Conference. It is linked to the strategic plan, in accordance with Resolution 71, by the allocation of financial resources to the strategic goals of the Union. Inputs Inputs are resources, such as financial, human, material and technological resources, used by activities to produce outputs. Mission Mission refers to the main overall purposes of the Union, as per the basic instruments of ITU. Objectives Objectives refer to the specific aims of the Sectoral and inter-Sectoral activities in a given period. Operational plan The operational plan is prepared on a yearly basis by each Bureau, in consultation with the relevant advisory group, and by the General Secretariat, in accordance with the strategic and financial plans. It contains the detailed plan for the subsequent year and a forecast for the following three-year period for each Sector and the General Secretariat. The Council reviews and approves the four-year rolling operational plans. Outcomes Outcomes provide an indication as to whether the objective is being achieved. Outcomes are usually partly, but not entirely, within the organization's control. ____________________ 8 The activities and outputs are defined in detail in the operational planning process, thereby ensuring a strong linkage between strategic and operational planning. Term Working version Outputs Outputs are the final tangible results, deliverables, products and services achieved by the Union in the implementation of the operational plans. Outputs are cost objects and are represented in the applicable cost-accounting system by internal orders. Performance indicators Performance indicators are the criteria used to measure the achievement of outputs or outcomes. These indicators may be qualitative or quantitative. Processes Set of consistent activities intended to meet an intended objective/goal. Results-based budgeting (RBB) Results-based budgeting (RBB) is the programme budget process in which: a) the programme is formulated in order to meet a set of predefined objectives and outcomes; b) the outcomes justify resource requirements, which are derived from and linked to outputs produced to achieve the outcomes; and c) actual performance in achieving outcomes is measured by outcome indicators. Results-based management (RBM) Results-based management is a management approach that directs organizational processes, resources, products and services towards the achievement of measurable results. It provides the management frameworks and tools for strategic planning, risk management, performance monitoring and evaluation and financing activities based on targeted results. Results framework A results framework is the strategic management tool used to plan, monitor, evaluate and report within the RBM methodology. It provides the necessary sequence to achieve desired results (results chain) - beginning with inputs, moving through activities and outputs, to outcomes - at the level of Sectoral and inter-Sectoral objectives, and desired impact - at the level of ITU-wide strategic goals and targets. It explains how results are to be achieved, including causal relationships and underlying assumptions and risks. The results framework reflects strategic level thinking across the entire organization. Strategic goals Strategic goals refer to the Union's high-level targets to which the objectives contribute, directly or indirectly. These relate to the whole of ITU. Term Working version Strategic plan The strategic plan defines the strategy of the Union for a four-year period in order to fulfil its mission. It defines strategic goals and objectives and represents the plan of the Union within that period. It is the main instrument embodying the Union's strategic vision. The strategic plan should be implemented within the context of the financial limits established by the Plenipotentiary Conference. Strategic risks Strategic risks refer to the uncertainties and untapped opportunities that affect an organization's strategy and strategy execution. Strategic risk management (SRM) Strategic risk management is a management practice that identifies and focuses action on uncertainties and untapped opportunities that affect an organization's ability to deliver on its mission. Strategic target Strategic targets are the expected results during the period of the strategic plan; they provide an indication as to whether the goal is being achieved. Targets may not always be achieved, for reasons that may be beyond the control of the Union. Strengths, weakness, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis A study done by an organization in order to find its strengths and weaknesses, and what problems or opportunities it should deal with. SWOT is formed from the initial letters of "strengths", "weaknesses", "opportunities" and "threats". Internal factors: - Strengths are capabilities that enable the organization to perform well -capabilities that need to be leveraged. - Weaknesses are characteristics that affect the good performance of the organization and need to be addressed. External factors: - Opportunities are trends, forces, events and ideas that the organization can capitalize on. - Threats are possible events or forces outside of the control of the organization that the organization needs to mitigate. Values ITU's shared and common beliefs that drive its priorities and guide all decision-making processes. Vision The better world ITU wants to see.

ICTs can be used to promote economic growth and enterprise development. Infrastructure development, human capacity building, information security and network security are critical to achieve these goals. We further recognize the need to effectively confront challenges and threats resulting from use of ICTs for purposes that are inconsistent with objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the integrity of the infrastructure within States, to the detriment of their security. It is necessary to prevent the abuse of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights", and that the challenges created by this misuse of ICT resources have only continued to increase since WSIS;</p>

The United Nations General Assembly has adopted resolutions 2665 (XX), 3160 (XVIII), 31/49, 37/9, 38/12, 39/6, 40/21, 41/40, 42/19 and 43/25, in which it recognizes the existence of a sovereignty dispute, referred to as the "Question of the Malvinas Islands", and calls for the Governments of the Argentine Republic and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to resume negotiations with the view to finding a peaceful, just and definitive solution to the dispute as soon as possible. For its part, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization has repeatedly expressed a similar view, most recently through the resolution adopted on 21 June 2018. Also, the General Assembly of the Organization of American States adopted on 5 June 2018 a new declaration on the question, which is declared to be of permanent hemispheric interest. In addition, the Argentine Republic declares that none of the provisions of the Final Acts of the Plenipotentiary Conference (Dubai, 2018) shall be interpreted or applied as affecting its rights over the Argentine Antarctic Sector delimited by the 25° West and 74° West meridians and the 60° South parallel, over which Argentina has claimed and maintains its sovereignty.

                  <p>Original: English For Ukraine: In signing the Final Acts of the Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union (Dubai, 2018), the delegation of Ukraine declares the following. The principle of complete recognition of the sovereign right of each State to regulate its telecommunication is enshrined in the Constitution of the International Telecommunication Union. D - 26 519 Starting from 20 February 2014, the Russian Federation, in violation of the fundamental norms and principles of international law, as well as its obligations under multilateral and bilateral treaties, has been committing an act of armed aggression against Ukraine, which has resulted in the illegal occupation of part of the territory of Ukraine - the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol (hereinafter "Crimea") and certain areas in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions. In its resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 the UN General Assembly affirmed the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders; acknowledged that invalid referendum held in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol on 16 March 2014, cannot form the basis for any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or of the city of Sevastopol; called upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol on the basis of the above-mentioned referendum and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status. In its subsequent resolutions 71/205 of 19 December 2016 and 72/190 of 19 December 2017 the UN General Assembly condemned the ongoing temporary occupation of Crimea by the Russian Federation and reaffirmed the non- recognition of its annexation. Moreover, the UN General Assembly resolution 29/3314 of 14 December 1974 "Definition of aggression" states that no territorial acquisition or special advantage resulting from aggression is or shall be recognized as lawful. Accordingly, Ukraine does not in any way recognize the illegal use of frequency spectrum and wrongful application of numbering codes of the Russian Federation within the illegally occupied territories of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. 520 D - 26 The Government of Ukraine also recalls the Agreed statement by the ITU Secretary-General at the 2014 Plenipotentiary Conference (Busan, 2014), published in Document PP-14/174, Annex B (https://www.itu.int/md/S14-PP-C- 0174/en), and the statement by the ITU Secretary-General, published in the ITU Operational Bulletin No. 1158 dated</p>

                  <p>October 2018 (https://www.itu.int/pub/T-SP-OB.1158-2018), through which the Union expressed its serious concerns about situation in Crimea and reaffirmed, inter alia, that the ITU took into account the relevant provisions of the UNGA resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014 "Territorial integrity of Ukraine" calling upon all specialized agencies of the United Nations "not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol and to refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status", as well as relevant provisions related to such status of the UNGA resolutions 71/205 (2016) and 72/190 (2017). In the above-mentioned statements the ITU Secretary-General further confirmed that the same principles shall also apply in respect of any actions that might be required of the General Secretariat and the three Bureaux, including the ITU publications and databases publishing, in order to assist Ukraine to ensure the use of all its international telecommunication services and resources as well as of any actions that might be taken by ITU conferences and assemblies pertaining to Ukraine's requirements in regard to use of the frequency spectrum and numbering codes on its territory. In the light of the provisions of the ITU Constitution and Administrative Regulations and taking into account the above UNGA resolutions, the Government of Ukraine declares its sovereign right to use the telecommunication networks and radio frequency resource of Ukraine in the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, which are now being illegally used by the Russian Federation in contravention of the provisions and principles of ITU's basic texts. D - 26 521 Responsibility for the consequences of any action by the Russian Federation in connection with the illegal use of radio frequency resource and the wrongful application of numbering resource, as well as responsibility for the consequences of any action which the Administration of Ukraine may be obliged to take in order to protect its own telecommunication networks and radio frequency resource from the actions of the Russian Federation in the temporarily occupied territories of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol will lie entirely with the Government of the Russian Federation. The Government of Ukraine calls on all Member States of ITU to refrain from routing in the telecommunication public networks of the outgoing/incoming international traffic, which can be received in the indices of numbers of the numbering plan of the Russian Federation, allocated for the use in the territory of Crimea, by telecommunications operators of the Russian Federation, and under the international mobile country identification code of land-based networks with radio access "250" (MCC) identification codes (MNC): 32; 33; 34; 60, and to take note of the fact that any notification to ITU and international coordination of frequency allotments and frequency assignments to radio electronic systems located in the temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol will continue to be exclusively carried out by the Administration of Ukraine. The Government of Ukraine reserves its right to take any measures that it may deem appropriate to safeguard its interests should other members fail to comply with the provisions of the Constitution and the Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (Geneva, 1992), as amended by Plenipotentiary Conferences (Kyoto, 1994; Minneapolis, 1998; Marrakesh, 2002; Antalya, 2006 and Guadalajara, 2010), or of the Administrative Regulations, or should reservations and declarations by any Members of the Union jeopardize the smooth operation of Ukraine's telecommunication services, affect its sovereignty, or entail an increase in its financial obligations to the Union. 522 D - 27</p>

Dubai, 2018) in accordance with relevant international agreements, including agreements between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States of America rejects the use of "State of Palestine" in Resolution 99 (Rev. Dubai, 2018) as a preferred nomenclature of the Palestinians as observers at the ITU. Furthermore, this nomenclature does not confer additional rights and privileges on the Palestinian delegation in the ITU beyond those that are otherwise stipulated in Resolution 99. The United States does not believe the "State of Palestine" qualifies as a sovereign State and does not recognize it as such. Only sovereign States may be Member States of the ITU. The United States remains committed to achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace that offers a brighter future to both Israel and the Palestinians. D - 61 545</p>

                  <p>Original: Russian For the Russian Federation: The delegation of the Russian Federation, with reference to Declaration No. 26 made by the delegation of Ukraine (published in Document 167 of 16 November 2018), firmly rejects the claims by the Government of Ukraine contained therein. In accordance with the universally recognized principle of equality of rights and self-determination of peoples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and based on the free and voluntary expression of the will of the Crimean people in the Crimea-wide referendum held in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol on 16 March 2014, and also in accordance with the Agreement between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Crimea on the accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation and the creation of new constituent entities within the Russian Federation (Moscow, 18 March 2014), the Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol have become part of the Russian Federation. This being the case, the Russian Federation has become fully responsible for providing communication services for the population of and facilities within the territory of the Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol, including in regard to compliance with the provisions of the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the ITU Radio Regulations and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974. 554 D - 73 Ukraine's calls relating to the management of the radio frequency spectrum and number resource on this territory of the Russian Federation, first and foremost, run counter to the requirements of the population, both in terms of daily needs and in the event of emergencies. The chosen frequency assignments to terrestrial stations within the territory of the Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol do not generate any harmful interference with stations beyond the borders of the Russian Federation. For its part and pursuant to its basic texts, ITU has no authority to discuss matters of a general political nature, including questions of the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of States. The Ukrainian document addresses matters related to the status of the Republic of Crimea and city of Sevastopol as parts of the Russian Federation and, therefore, falls outside of ITU's mandate. Thus, the Russian Federation is acting in full compliance with Article 1 of the ITU Constitution, in satisfying requirements and ensuring availability of telecommunication/ICT means for the inhabitants of the above-mentioned subjects of the Russian Federation. Should any State take measures to the detriment of the interests of the Russian Federation, the Russian Federation shall reserve the right to take any necessary countermeasures to safeguard its interests in accordance with international law. With regard to the areas in the Donetsk and Lugansk regions referred to, the Russian Federation continues to support a swift resolution of the conflict in this region on the basis of the package of measures signed in Minsk and approved with the adoption of United Nations Security Council resolution 2202 (2015) of 17 February 2015.

We do not recognize the illegal referendum in Crimea, which was in clear violation of the Ukrainian Constitution. We strongly condemn the Russian Federation's illegal seizure of Crimea and Sevastopol. We further believe that there is no place for the use of force and coercion to change borders in Europe in the 21st century. Therefore, we call upon the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to implement fully the terms of resolution 68/262 (2014) of the United Nations General Assembly that "calls upon all States, international organizations and specialized agencies not to recognize any alteration of the status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol" and to "refrain from any action or dealing that might be interpreted as recognizing any such altered status". 558 D - 77 In this regard, we welcome the statement by the ITU Secretary-General at the 2014 Plenipotentiary Conference (Busan, 2014), published in Document PP- 14/174, Annex B (https://www.itu.int/md/S14-PP-C-0174/en), and the statement by the ITU Secretary-General, published in the ITU Operational Bulletin No. 1158 dated 15 October 2018 (https://www.itu.int/pub/T-SP- OB.1158-2018) and encourage the ITU Secretary-General and the Directors of the three Bureaux to continue to take all necessary actions in order to assist Ukraine to ensure the use of its telecommunications resources in accordance with the Constitution and Convention of the International Telecommunication Union and the Administrative Regulations.</p>

                  <p>Original: English For the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: The delegation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, referring to the declaration made by the Argentine Republic (No. 14), declares on behalf of its Government that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland has no doubt about its sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. The principle and the right of self-determination as set out in Article 1.2 of the Charter of the United Nations and Article 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights underlies our position. The United Kingdom is clear that the future of the Falkland Islands should be determined by the people of the Falkland Islands, in accordance with our obligations under the UN Charter. D - 83 563 In March 2013 the Falkland Islands Government held a referendum to seek the views of the people. The overwhelming majority of voters (99.8%) voted to remain an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom. The democratically elected representatives of the Falkland Islands presented the result of that referendum to the Special Committee on Decolonisation in June 2013 and asked the Committee to respect the principle of self-determination. They once again reiterated the historical facts that the Falkland Islands had no indigenous people and that no civilian population was removed prior to their ancestors settling on the Islands. They confirmed that they are a legitimate people with the right to have their wishes respected. The United Kingdom remains fully committed to defending the rights of the people of the Falkland Islands to determine their own political, social and economic future and calls on the Republic of Argentina to respect their wishes. Finally, the United Kingdom has no doubt about its sovereignty over South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the British Antarctic Territory, and their surrounding maritime areas.</p>
